=====

`tile <https://tile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a command-line interface for stitching overlapping tomographic projection datasets in the horizontal direction. Stitching is done manually by selecting the shift for each tile. The selection of correct set of shifts is made by looking at reconstructed slices and/or projections.
